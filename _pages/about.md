I am a Third-year Master student at the Joint Graduate School (Double degree) of Southeast University and Monash University, advised by Prof. [Guilin Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my Bachelor's degree from Hefei University in June 2022. Also, I worked as a research intern under the guidance of Prof. [Chenyu You](https://chenyuyou.me/) at Stony Brook University in 2024.

My research areas include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs (KG). Currently, my main research focus is on enhancing the performance of LLMs using heterogeneous data (text, graphs and tables). Additionally, I am also highly interested in multimodal (vision-language) models.
