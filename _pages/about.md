I am a second-year student at the Joint Graduate School (JGS) of Southeast University and Monash University. My graduate advisor is Professor [Guilin Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my Bachelor's degree from Hefei University in June 2022. I am expected to earn my Master by research degree from Southeast University and my Master by course degree from Monash University in June 2025. 

My research fields include Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Graphs (KG). At present, my research interest lies in enhancing LLMs-based Question Answering systems, evaluating the performance of LLMs in QA, and developing methods for LLMs to handle hybrid data, such as structured KGs and semi-structured tables. Additionally, I have a strong interest in multimodal (vision, language, and speech) LLMs.
